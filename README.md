# What is this repository?

This repository is a traning repository for students to manipulate the DOM during a support. Every manipulation should be done in JS in the script.js file.

## First Manipulation:

- Fix the h1 to show "La Wild" instead of "La Ouilde"
- Fix the copyrights to show "Copyrights" followed by the name of the students in your support.
